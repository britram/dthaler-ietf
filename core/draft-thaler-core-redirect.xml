      <t> This document allows a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) server to redirect
          a client to a new URI.  The primary use case is to allow a client using multicast
          CoAP discovery to learn a COAPS endpoint of the server, without the server revealing
          privacy-sensitive information.  This improves security and privacy in environments
          with untrusted clients.

    <section title='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
        <t> The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/> is a specialized
            web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks.
            When COAP nodes can appear on a network that allows untrusted clients, security and
            privacy issues can arise, as discussed in Section 11 of <xref target="RFC7252"/>.
        </t>
        <t> This document focuses on a solution for a specific use case: preventing
            privacy-sensitive information from being passed to untrusted clients, especially
            as part of resource discovery.  The resource discovery phase is important because
            DTLS is not used with multicast COAP.
        </t>
        <t> The specific relevant threats are:
            <list style="symbols">
            <t> Correlation across location: If a COAP server can move between multiple networks
                in which an attacker has a presence, the attacker can potentially correlate
                responses from the COAP server across the two locations and determine that the
                same entity is moving between those two locations.  This can even be used to
                identify individuals, such as when the COAP server is in a wearable device.
            </t>
            <t> Correlation across time: If a COAP server is available periodically in the same location
                over a long time, an attacker in that location can potentially
                correlate reponses over time and determine that it is the same entity,
                even though the IP address and layer-2 address may be different.  This can even
                be used to identify individuals, such as when the COAP server is in a wearable device.
            </t>
            <t> Fingerprinting: Device-specific vulnerability exploitation can be most easily
                accomplished if an attacker can easily narrow down what software the server
                runs.  Information returned via multicast service discovery can facilitate
                such fingerprinting.
            </t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <t> For more discussion of these threats, see Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC6973"/>,
            Section 3 of <xref target="RFC7721"/>, and 
            <xref target="I-D.winfaa-intarea-broadcast-consider"/>.
        </t>
        <t> To mitigate these threats, this document defines the ability for a server to redirect
            a client to another URI.  Specifically, the expected use is that in response to an
            unsecured COAP request, a privacy-sensitive server could be configured to simply respond
            by redirecting the client to a COAPS endpoint, thus allowing the client to discover
            a unicast endpoint, but not to discover any privacy-sensitive information without
            establishing a secured unicast connection.
        </t>
        <t> By comparison, HTTP (Section 6.4.2 of <xref target="RFC7231"/>) redirects with 301 (Moved Permanently)
            and a Location header containing the new URI.  COAP, on the other hand, defines Location-Path and 
            Location-Query COAP options <xref target="RFC7252"/> for those components of the URI, but did not
            define options for the other URI components. <xref target="ListDiscussion"/> explains:

            <list style="empty"> 
                <t> While early drafts of CoAP did have some forms of redirection, 
                    we found that the use cases most people had in mind did not call for redirects.  
                    The main reason is that in a CoRE world, URIs are usually found through a discovery 
                    process, and these URIs can be made to point to the right place right away.
                </t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <t> The use case motivating this document, however, is specifically for redirects as part of the
            discovery process itself.
        </t>

        <section title='Example'>
        <t> 
            Existing clients conforming to the OIC 1.1 Core spec <xref target="OIC1.1Core"/>
            sections 10 and 11.3.5 do discovery by sending a multicast CoAP GET for "/oic/res".
            Existing servers will respond with links to a set of resources, but that information
            might be privacy-sensitive in some cases.  For example, it might contain sufficient
            a unique identifier of the server, or information sufficient for an attacker
            to determine what version of what software it runs.  (A sample response can be
            found in section 10.2 of <xref target="OIC1.1Core"/>.)   Hence a privacy-sensitive
            server needs a way to be discovered by trusted clients without revealing privacy-sensitive
            information to untrusted observers.
            A redirect allows a client to send the same request (thus not increasing the
            amount of multicast traffic on the network).
        </t>
        <t> For example, consider a network with a privacy-sensitive server, and a legacy server.
            A client wants to efficiently discover both servers.  The client can send a single
            multicast GET for "/oic/res", and the legacy server would send a unicast response
            with the requested data, whereas the privacy-sensitive server would respond with
            a unicast redirect to "coaps://&lt;ipaddr&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/oic/res".  The client can then
            generate a unicast GET over coaps to get the actual data, if permitted, from the
            privacy-sensitive server.  This mechanism keeps the latency and number of messages
            to a minimum.
            </t>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section title='Alternatives Considered'>
        <t> This section discusses why existing alternatives are not sufficient.
        </t>

        <section title='Just use normal multicast discovery'>
            <t> Normal multicast discovery is susceptible to the threats discussed earlier.
                Another approach would be for multicast discovery to return only generic information
                that is the same for every device, and hence does not reveal any privacy related information or
                allow fingerprinting.  This is undesirable since the resource handler would have to return
                different information based on whether the client is authenticated vs. unauthenticated,
                and thus is complex and error prone to implement and maintain.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Just use a resource directory'>
            <t> A resource directory could be used and only provide data to authenticated clients.
                However, the same problem still remains as to how to discover the resource directory itself.
                One could potentially use an alternate discovery protocol such as DNS-SD, but this introduces
                additional complexity when clients otherwise just use COAP for both discovery and communication.
                In addition, requiring a resource directory to be implemented, deployed, and maintained
                in a constrained environment presents an extra deployment burden that is desirable to avoid.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Use Alternative-Address'>
            <t> Section 4.5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls"/> provides an Alternative-Address
                option, which can be used to redirect the client to another transport address.  However,
                it states:
                <list style="empty"> 
                    <t> The Alternative-Address elective option requests the peer to instead
                        open a connection of the same kind as the present connection to the
                        alternative transport address given.  Its value is in the form
                        "authority" as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC3986].
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t> Thus, Alternative-Address can indicate another authority component,
                but it explicitly requires the same URI scheme to be used, so it cannot be used
                to redirect from coap to coaps.
            </t>

      <t> Preventing identifying information from being observed by untrusted

          the privacy issues discussed in <xref target="intro"/>. That is, one

          that does not reveal a stable identifier to clients before authentication is

          that only reveal the identity of both endpoints if authentication succeeds,
          but they may not yet be available in current standards and popular code bases.
