    <abstract>
      <t> Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol,
          we have seen a number of transitions, throughout the protocol stack,
          from one protocol or technology to another.  Many protocols and
          technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to
          alternatives or to easily deploy extensions, and thus some transitions,
          such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document
          attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions,
          and also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan.
      </t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t> A "transition" is "the process or period of changing from one state
          or condition to another.  There are several types of such transitions,
          including both technical transitions (e.g., changing protocols or
          deploying an extension) and organizational transitions (e.g., changing
          what organization manages the IETF web site, or the RFC production center).
          This document focuses solely on technical transitions, although some
          principles might apply to other types as well.
      </t>
      <t> There have been many IETF and IAB RFCs and IAB statements discussing
          transitions of various sorts.  Most are protocol-specific documents
          about specific transitions.  For example, some relevant ones in which
          the IAB has been involved include:
      </t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t> IAB RFC 3424 <xref target="RFC3424"/> recommended that any technology
              for so-called "unilateral self-address fixing (UNSAF)" across NATs
              include an exit strategy to transition away from such a mechanism.
              Since the IESG, not the IAB, approves IETF documents, the IESG
              thus became the body to enforce (or not) such a requirement.
          </t>
          <t> IAB RFC 4690 <xref target="RFC4690"/> gave recommendations around
              internationalized domain names. It discussed issues around the process
              of transitioning to new versions of Unicode, and this resulted in the
              creation of the IETF Precis WG to address this problem.
          </t>
          <t> The IAB statement on "Follow-up-work on NAT-PT"
              <xref target="IabIpv6TransitionStatement"/> pointed out gaps at the time
              in transitioning to IPv6, and this resulted in the rechartering of the
              IETF Behave WG to solve this problem.
          </t>
      </list></t>
      <t> More recently, the IAB has done work on more generally applicable principles,
          including two RFCs.
      </t>
      <t> IAB RFC 5218 <xref target="RFC5218"/> on "What Makes for a Successful Protocol?"
          studied specifically what factors contribute to, and detract from,
          the success of a protocol and it made a number of recommendations.  It
          discussed two types of transitions: "initial success" (the transition
          to the technology) and extensibility (the transition to updated
          versions of it).  The principles and recommendations in that document
          are generally applicable to all technical transitions. Some important principles 
          included:
      </t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t> Incentive: Transition is easiest when the benefits come to those bearing the costs.
              That is, the benefits should outweigh the costs at *each* entity.
              Some successful cases did this by providing incentives (e.g., tax breaks),
              or by reducing costs (e.g., freely available source), or by imposing
              costs of not transitioning (e.g., regulation), or even by narrowing
              the scenarios of applicability to just the cases where benefits do    
              outweigh costs at all relevant entities.
          </t>
          <t> Incremental Deployability: Backwards compatibility makes transition easier.
              Furthermore, transition is easiest when changing only one entity still
              benefits that entity.  In the easiest case, the benefit immediately
              outweighs the cost and so entities are naturally incented to transition.
              More commonly, the benefits only outweigh the costs once a significant
              number of other entities also transition.  Unfortunately, in such cases,
              the natural incentive is often to delay transitioning.
          </t>
          <t> Total Cost: Don't underestimate the cost of things other than the
              hardware/software itself.  For example, operational tools and processes,
              personnel training, business model (accounting/billing) dependencies,
              and legal (regulation, patents, etc.) costs all add up.
          </t>
          <t> Extensibility: Design for extensibility so that things can be fixed up later.
          </t>
      </list></t>
      <t> IAB RFC 7305 <xref target="RFC7305"/> reported on a IAB workshop
          on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT).  Like
          RFC 5218, this workshop also discussed economic aspects of transition,
          not just technical aspects.  Some important observations included:
      </t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t> Early-Adopter Incentives: Part of Bitcoin's strategy was extra incentives
              for early adopters compared to late adopters.  That is, providing a long-term 
              advantage to early
              adopters can help stimulate transition even when the initial costs outweigh
              the initial benefit.
          </t>
          <t> Policy Partners: Policy-making organizations of various sorts (RIRs,
              ICANN, etc.) can be important partners in enabling and facilitating
              transition.
          </t>
      </list></t>
      <t> The remainder of this document continues the discussion in those two RFCs
          and provides some additional thoughts on the topic of transition strategies
          and plans.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Transition vs. Co-existence" anchor="coexist">
        <t> We need to distinguish between a strict "flag-day" style transition where an 
            old mechanism
            is immediately replaced with a new mechanism, vs. a looser co-existence based
            approach where transition proceeds in stages where a new mechanism is first
            added alongside an existing one for some overlap period, and then the old
            mechanism is removed at a later stage.
        </t>
        <t> When a new mechanism is backwards compatible with an existing mechanism, transition is
            easiest, and the difference between the two types of transition is not 
            particularly significant.
            However, when no backwards compatibility exists (such as in the IPv4 to IPv6 transition),
            a transition plan must choose either a "flag day" or a period of co-existence.
            When a large number of entities are involved, a flag day becomes impractical.
            Coexistence, on the other hand, involves additional costs of maintaining two
            separate mechanisms during the overlap period which could be quite long.
            Furthermore, the longer the overlap period, the more the old mechanism might
            get further deployment and thus increase the overall pain of transition.
        </t>
        <t> Often the decision between a "flag day" and a sustained co-existence period
            may be difficult, such as in the case of IDNA2008 
            <xref target="RFC5891"/>
            <xref target="RFC5895"/>
            and Unicode TR46
            <xref target="TR46"/>.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Translation/Adaptation Location">
        <t> A translation or adaptation layer is often required if the old and new
            mechanisms are not interoperable.  Care must be taken when determining
            where such a translator is best placed. 
        </t>
        <t> Requiring a translator in the middle of the path can hamper end-to-end
            security and reliability.  For example, see the discussion of 
            network-based filtering in <xref target="I-D.iab-filtering-considerations"/>.
        </t>
        <t> On the other hand, requiring a translation layer within an
            endpoint can be a resource issue in some cases, such as if the endpoint
            could be a constrained node <xref target="RFC7228"/>.
        </t>
        <t> Any transition strategy for a non-backward-compatible mechanism should 
            include a discussion of where it is placed and a rationale.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Translation Plans">
        <t> A good transition plan includes at least the following components:
        </t>
        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t> An explanation of incentives for each entity involved
            </t>
            <t> A description of transition phases.  For example, there might
                be pilot, co-existence, deprecation, and removal phases for
                a transition from one technology to another incompatible one.
            </t>
            <t> A proposed timeline
            </t>
            <t> A way to effectively communicate the proposed plan to the
                entities affected, and incorporate their feedback
            </t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
        <t> This document discusses attributes of protocol transitions.  Some
            types of transition can adversely affect security or privacy.  For
            example, requiring a translator in the middle of the path may hamper
            end-to-end security and privacy, since it creates an attractive target.
            For further discussion of some of these issues, see Section 5 of

    <section title="Case Studies">
        <section title="Explicit Congestion Notification">
            <t> Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism to replace
                loss as the only signal for the detection of congestion with an 
                explicit signal sent from a router to the recipient of a packet, 
                then reflected back to the sender. It was standardized in 2000 
                in <xref target="RFC3168"/>, and the mechanism consists of two 
                parts: congestion detection in the IP layer, reusing two bits of 
                the old IP Type of Service (TOS) field, and congestion feedback 
                in the transport layer. Feedback in TCP uses two TCP flags, ECN 
                Echo and Congestion Window Reduced. Together with a suitably 
                configured active queue management (AQM), ECN can improve TCP 
                performance on congested links.
            </t>
            <t> The deployment of ECN is a case study in failed transition followed 
                by possible redemption. Initial deployment of ECN in the early and
                mid 2000s led to severe problems with some network equipment, including 
                home router crashes and reboots when packets with ECN IP or TCP 
                flags was received <xref target="TSV2007"/>. 
                This led to firewalls stripping ECN IP and TCP flags, or even 
                dropping packets with these flags set. This stalled deployment. 
                The need for both endpoints (to negotiate and support ECN) and 
                on-path devices (to mark traffic when congestion occurs) to 
                cooperate in order to see any benefits from ECN deployment was a 
                further issue. The deployment of ECN had failed.
            </t>
            <t> In the late 2000s, Linux and Windows servers defaulted to "passive ECN 
                support", meaning they would negotiate ECN if asked by the 
                client, but would not ask to negotiate ECN by default. This 
                decision was regarded as without risk: only if a client were 
                explicitly configured to negotiate ECN would any possible 
                connectivity problems surface. Gradually, this has increased 
                server support in the Internet from near zero in 2008, to 11% 
                of the top million Alexa webservers in 2011, to 30% in 2012, 
                to 65% in late 2014. In the meantime, the risk to connectivity 
                of ECN negotiation has reduced dramatically <xref target="PAM2015"/>,
                leading to ongoing work to make Windows, Apple iOS, OSX, and Linux clients 
                negotiate ECN by default. It is hoped that a critical mass of 
                clients and servers negotiating ECN will provide an incentive to 
                mark congestion on ECN-enabled traffic, thus breaking the logjam.
