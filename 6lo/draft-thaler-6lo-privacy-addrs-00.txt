         Enabling Privacy Addressing With 6LoWPAN Technologies
                   draft-thaler-6lo-privacy-addrs-00

Abstract

   A potentially common misconception is that header 6LowPAN header
   compression is incompatible (or at least inefficient) with the notion
   of using addresses with sufficient entropy.  This draft attempts to
   dispel that notion, and specifies how privacy addressing can be used
   on 6LoWPAN technologies, without additional overhead in data packets.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6973 [RFC6973] discusses privacy considerations for Internet
   protocols, and Section 5.2 in particular covers a number of privacy-
   specific threats.  In the context of IPv6 address, Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy] provides further
   elaboration on the applicability of the privacy threats.  When
   interface identifiers (IIDs) are generated without sufficient
   entropy, devices and users become vulnerable to the various threats
   discussed there, including correlation of activities over time,
   location tracking, address scanning, and device-specific
   vulnerability exploitation.

   Interfaces identifiers formed from IEEE identifiers can have
   insufficient entropy unless the IEEE identifier itself has sufficient
   entropy, and enough (typically on the order of 60 or more) bits of
   entropy are carried over into the IPv6 address to have a sufficiently
   large "anonymity set" as defined in [RFC6973].  Furthermore, IEEE-
   identifier-based IIDs are also insufficient to prevent location
   tracking unless the IEEE identifier itself is different at each
   network location.  This observation suggests that the privacy threats
   can be mitigated in either of two ways: either use an IPv6 address
   generation mechanism that is not IEEE-identifier-based, or else make
   sure the IEEE identifier contains around 60 bits of entropy and is
   changed if a device moves to a different network.

   Furthermore, to mitigate the threat of correlation of activities over
   time, [RFC4941] specifies the notion of a "temporary" address to be
   used for sessions that should not be linkable to more permanent

   identifiers (such as a DNS name, user name, or stable hardware
   address).  Such temporary addresses are appropriate for connections
   (typically locally-initiated outbound sessions) that an attacker
   cannot link to a stable identifier such as a user name or DNS name.
   Indeed, the default address selection rules [RFC6724] now prefer
   temporary addresses by default for outgoing connections.  When
   temporary addresses are used, a new temporary address is periodically
   (default is 1 day in xref target='RFC4941'/>) generated, which limits
   the threat of correlation of activies over time to that period.  The
   address itself though may still be usable for existing long-lived
   connections (but not new connections) for some longer period (default
   is 1 week); this allows for not breaking application sessions,
   especially those that might be initiated shortly before a new
   temporary address is generated.  This fact means that multiple
   temporary addresses can exist at the same time, one for new
   connections, and one or more (often up to 6, per the default periods)
   old ones for long-lived connections.  This is in addition to zero or
   more "stable" addresses that might be used for connections that are
   linkable to more permanent identifiers such as DNS names or user
   names.  Whereas most threats could be mitigated if the IEEE
   identifier contains sufficient entropy and is different per-network,
   mitigating the threat of correlation of activities over time
   typically cannot be done using an IEEE identifier, since mitigating
   such a threat typically involves the ability to use multiple IPv6
   addresses simultaneously whereas typically only one IEEE identifier
   can be used at a time.

   Finally, allowing efficient use of addresses that are not IEEE-
   identifier-based also has additional security benefits not specific
   to privacy.  For example, addresses such as Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972] and Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs)
   [RFC5535] can be used in security protocols such as Secure Neighbor
   Discovery (SeND) [RFC6496], IPsec, etc.  Such techniques rely on
   having around 60 or more bits of entropy in the address to provide
   sufficient cryptographic protection.

   TODO: add mention of [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids]

   There has been some concern that such approaches would necessarily
   interfere with efficient header compression for IPv6 over IEEE
   802.15.4-based networks [RFC6282], as it is important to keep data
   packets small on such networks.  This document specifies how to use
   such addresses on these networks while avoiding extra overhead.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in Section 3 of [RFC6973],
   including terms such as "(un)linkability" and "anonymity set".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Compression Details

   The LOWPAN_IPHC encoding format specified in Section 3.1 of RFC 6282
   [RFC6282] defines a method for deriving IIDs from the source and/or
   destination addresses in the encapsulation header.  Unicast IPv6
   addresses may be compressed to 64, 16, or 0 bits in the encoded IPv6
   header.

3.1.  Use of IEEE-Identifier-Based Addresses

   As noted earlier, some privacy threats, could be mitigated using per-
   network "randomized" IEEE identifiers with 60 or more bits of
   entropy.  A number of such proposals can be found at
   <https://mentor.ieee.org/privecsg/documents>.  Using IPv6 addresses
   derived from such IEEE identifiers would be roughly equivalent to
   those specified in [RFC7217].

   Such addresses would be encoded as usual using the LOWPAN_IPHC
   encoding format.  For example, if the source and destination
   addresses are both on-link and derived from the IEEE identifier in
   the encapsulating header:

   o  SAC (Source Address Compression) is set to 0 to indicate stateless
      compression.

   o  SAM (Source Address Mode) is set to 11 to indicate the address is
      fully elided and can be computed from the encapsulating header.

   o  DAC (Destination Address Compression) is set to 0 to indicate
      stateless compression.

   o  DAM (Destination Address Mode) is set to 11 to indicate the
      address is fully elided and can be computed from the encapsulating
      header.

3.2.  Use of 16-Bit Short Addresses

   An IPv6 address formed (per Secton 6 of [RFC4944]) from an IEEE
   802.15.4 16-bit short address does not provide sufficient entropy to
   fully mitigate address scanning, as the size of the address scan
   search space depends on the entropy in the IID, and only 15 bits are
   available for unicast addresses.  An adversary could also use
   statisical methods to determine the size of the L2 address space and
   thereby make some inference regarding the underlying technology being
   IEEE 802.15.4 on a given link.  As such, this address generation
   mechanism SHOULD NOT be used on networks connected to the Internet or
   any other network where privacy threats may be an issue.

   It might be possible to construct IPv6 addresses from 16-bit short
   addresses using an alternate mechanism that mitigates address scans,
   by all nodes on a given L2 network having a shared secret and using a
   one-way hash of the shared secret together with the short address, to
   generate the IID, thus causing the IIDs to be spread out among the
   full range of IIDs.  Specifying the details of such a scheme is left
   for future work, if there is interest.

3.3.  Use of Non-IEEE-Identifier-Based Addresses

   Unicast addresses that are not IEEE-identifier based SHOULD be
   compressed to 0 bits as follows, using stateful context-based
   compression where all IID bits are covered by context information.
   It is also worth pointing out that, unlike stateless compression,
   stateful context-based compression can also allow compressing
   addresses of nodes outside the local network (i.e., where the IEEE
   identifier in the encapsulating header is that of a router rather
   than the peer) and hence can provide greater savings in such cases.

3.3.1.  Source Address

   SAC (Source Address Compression) MUST be set to 1 to indicate
   stateful context-based compression.

   SAM (Source Address Mode) MUST be set to 11 to indicate that the
   address is fully elided.

3.3.2.  Destination Address

   DAC (Destination Address Compression) MUST be set to 1 to indicate
   stateful context-based compression.

   DAM (Destination Address Mode) MUST be set to 11 to indicate that the
   address is fully elided.

3.3.3.  Context Identifier

   When non-IEEE-identifier-based addresses are used as specified in
   this document, each address MUST be associated with a separate
   context.

   LOWPAN_IPHC supports up to 16 source address contexts and 16
   destination address contexts, allowing for simultaneous use of up to
   16 source addresses and 16 destination addresses that are not IEEE-
   identifier based.  Context 0 is the default context if the CID
   (Context Identifier Extension) octet is absent, and other values
   require the CID to be present.  As such, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   address most commonly used (typically either the stable non-temporary
   address, or the currently preferred temporary address) be assigned to
   context 0 so that the presence of the CID octet is minimized.

   If this results in the desire to change the assignment over time,
   this would necessitate the use of a dynamic context negotiation
   mechanism.  For example, if the set of destinations can vary
   dynamically over time, such as if the device responds to arbitrary
   other nodes querying it, the destination-context-to-address mapping
   may change when a new peer wants to communicate with the device.
   Similarly, if temporary addresses are used as source or destination
   addresses, then some context-to-address mapping may change once a
   day.

   If temporary addresses are not used, and the set of peers with which
   a device communicates on a given network is fixed and 16 or fewer in
   number, then a static context-to-address mapping for that network is
   sufficient.

   If the device is capable of roaming between multiple networks, then
   any context information MUST be per-network, and not used on other
   networks.

3.3.4.  Context Distribution

   TODO: read and reference RFC 6775 (and determine whether that is
   sufficient or needs an extension), especially Section 8.1, regarding
   context negotiation.

   Section 4.2 of [RFC6775] defines the 6LoWPAN Context Option (6CO) for
   use in Neighbor Discovery.  Since each non-IEEE-identifier-based
   address requires its own context, the Context Length field MUST be
   set to 128 in the 6CO containing such context informaiton.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This entire document is about security considerations and
   mitigations.

   RFC 6775 [RFC6775] section 11 states, "In some future deployments,
   one might want to use SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971]
   [RFC3972].  This is possible with the ARO as sent between hosts and
   routers, since the address that is being registered is the IPv6
   source address of the NS and SEND verifies the IPv6 source address of
   the packet."
