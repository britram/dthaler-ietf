         Enabling Privacy Addressing With 6LoWPAN Technologies
                   draft-thaler-6lo-privacy-addrs-00

Abstract

   It is commonly assumed today that 6LowPAN header compression is
   incompatible (or at least inefficient) with the notion of using
   addresses with sufficient entropy to mitigate various privacy
   threats.  This draft explores ways to dispel that notion, and
   discusses how privacy addressing could be used on 6LoWPAN
   technologies without additional overhead in data packets.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6973 [RFC6973] discusses privacy considerations for Internet
   protocols, and Section 5.2 in particular covers a number of privacy-
   specific threats.  In the context of IPv6 addresses, Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy] provides further
   elaboration on the applicability of the privacy threats.  When
   interface identifiers (IIDs) are generated without sufficient
   entropy, devices and users become vulnerable to the various threats
   discussed there, including correlation of activities over time,
   location tracking, address scanning, and device-specific
   vulnerability exploitation.

   Interfaces identifiers formed from IEEE identifiers can have
   insufficient entropy unless the IEEE identifier itself has sufficient
   entropy, and enough bits of entropy are carried over into the IPv6
   address to sufficiently mitigate the threats.  (Typically "enough"
   bits of entropy means on the order of 60 or more bits; ideally all 64
   bits of the IID would be used, but historically a couple bits have
   been excluded for reasons discussed in [RFC7421].)  Furthermore,
   IEEE-identifier-based IIDs are also insufficient to prevent location
   tracking unless the IEEE identifier itself is different at each
   network location.  This observation suggests that the privacy threats
   can be mitigated in either of two ways: either use an IPv6 address
   generation mechanism that is not IEEE-identifier-based, or else make

   sure the IEEE identifier contains around 60 bits of entropy and is
   changed if a device moves to a different network.  For this reason,
   [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids] recommends using the address generation
   scheme in [RFC7217] by default, rather than IEEE-identifier-based
   addresses.

   Furthermore, to mitigate the threat of correlation of activities over
   time, [RFC4941] specifies the notion of a "temporary" address to be
   used for sessions that should not be linkable to a more permanent
   identifier (such as a DNS name, user name, or stable hardware
   address).  Such temporary addresses are appropriate for connections
   (typically locally-initiated outbound sessions) that an attacker
   cannot link to a stable identifier such as a user name or DNS name.
   Indeed, the default address selection rules [RFC6724] now prefer
   temporary addresses by default for outgoing connections.  When
   temporary addresses are used, a new temporary address is periodically
   (default is 1 day in [RFC4941]) generated, which limits the threat of
   correlation of activies over time to that period.  The address itself
   though may still be usable for existing long-lived connections (but
   not new connections) for some longer period (default is 1 week); this
   allows for not breaking application sessions, especially those that
   might be initiated shortly before a new temporary address is
   generated.  This fact means that multiple temporary addresses can
   exist at the same time, one for new connections, and one or more
   (often up to 6, per the default periods) old ones for long-lived
   connections.  This is in addition to zero or more "stable" addresses
   that might be used for connections that are linkable to more
   permanent identifiers such as DNS names or user names.  Whereas most
   threats could be mitigated if the IEEE identifier contains sufficient
   entropy and is different per-network, mitigating the threat of
   correlation of activities over time typically cannot be done using an
   IEEE identifier, since mitigating such a threat typically involves
   the ability to use multiple IPv6 addresses simultaneously whereas
   typically only one IEEE identifier can be used at a time.

   Finally, allowing efficient use of addresses that are not IEEE-
   identifier-based also has additional security benefits not specific
   to privacy.  For example, addresses such as Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972] and Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs)
   [RFC5535] can be used in security protocols such as Secure Neighbor
   Discovery (SeND) [RFC6496], IPsec, etc.  Such techniques rely on
   having around 60 or more bits of entropy in the address to provide
   sufficient cryptographic protection.

   RFC 6775 [RFC6775] already allows for the use of non-IEEE-identifier-
   based addresses, such as those provided by DHCPv6 [RFC3315].  There
   has been some concern, however, that such approaches necessarily
   interfere with efficient header compression for IPv6 over IEEE

   802.15.4-based networks [RFC6282], as it is important to keep data
   packets small on such networks.  This document discusses how one
   might use such addresses on these networks while avoiding extra
   overhead.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in Section 3 of [RFC6973],
   including terms such as "(un)linkability" and "anonymity set".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Compression Details

   The LOWPAN_IPHC encoding format specified in Section 3.1 of RFC 6282
   [RFC6282] defines a method for deriving IIDs from the source and/or
   destination addresses in the encapsulation header.  Unicast IPv6
   addresses may be compressed to 64, 16, or 0 bits in the encoded IPv6
   header.

3.1.  Use of IEEE-Identifier-Based Addresses

   As noted earlier, some privacy threats, could be mitigated using per-
   network "randomized" IEEE identifiers with 60 or more bits of
   entropy.  A number of such proposals can be found at
   <https://mentor.ieee.org/privecsg/documents>.  Using IPv6 addresses
   derived from such IEEE identifiers would be roughly equivalent to
   those specified in [RFC7217].

   Such addresses would be encoded as usual using the LOWPAN_IPHC
   encoding format.  For example, if the source and destination
   addresses are both on-link and derived from the IEEE identifier in
   the encapsulating header:

   o  SAC (Source Address Compression) is set to 0 to indicate stateless
      compression.

   o  SAM (Source Address Mode) is set to 11 to indicate the address is
      fully elided and can be computed from the encapsulating header.

   o  DAC (Destination Address Compression) is set to 0 to indicate
      stateless compression.

   o  DAM (Destination Address Mode) is set to 11 to indicate the
      address is fully elided and can be computed from the encapsulating
      header.

Internet-Draft          6LoWPAN Privacy Addresses          February 2015


3.2.  Use of 16-Bit Short Addresses

   An IPv6 address formed (per Section 6 of [RFC4944]) from an IEEE
   802.15.4 16-bit short address does not provide sufficient entropy to
   fully mitigate address scanning, as the size of the address scan
   search space depends on the entropy in the IID, and only 15 bits are
   available for unicast addresses.  An adversary could also use
   statisical methods to determine the size of the L2 address space and
   thereby make some inference regarding the underlying technology being
   IEEE 802.15.4 on a given link.  As such, this address generation
   mechanism SHOULD NOT be used on networks connected to the Internet or
   any other network where privacy threats may be an issue.

   It might be possible to construct IPv6 addresses from 16-bit short
   addresses using an alternate mechanism that mitigates address scans,
   if all nodes on a given L2 network have a shared secret (such as the
   key needed to get on the layer-2 network) and generate the IID by
   using a one-way 64-bit hash of the shared secret together with the
   short address.  The use of such a hash causes the IIDs to be spread
   out among the full range of IIDs.

   "Temporary" addresses could possibly be generated in the same way by
   also including in the hash the Version Number from the Authoritative
   Border Router Option (ABDO) if any.  This would allow changing
   temporary addresses whenever the Version Number is changed (even if
   the set of prefix or context information is unchanged).  Such a
   scheme would likely require using the Context Identifier (CID) to
   distinguish between non-temporary addresses, "current" temporary
   addresses, and "past" temporary addresses based on a previous Version
   Number.

   Specifying further details of such a scheme is left for future
   versions of this draft, if there is interest.

3.3.  Use of Non-IEEE-Identifier-Based Addresses

   Unicast addresses that are not IEEE-identifier based SHOULD be
   compressed to 0 bits as follows, using stateful context-based
   compression where all IID bits are covered by context information.
   It is also worth pointing out that this scheme would allow
   compressing DHCPv6-assigned addresses even in networks where privacy
   is not a primary concern.  Furthermore, unlike stateless compression,
   stateful context-based compression can also allow compressing
   addresses of nodes outside the local network (i.e., where the IEEE
   identifier in the encapsulating header is that of a router rather
   than the peer) and hence can provide greater savings in such cases.

3.3.1.  Source Address Compression

   SAC (Source Address Compression) MUST be set to 1 to indicate
   stateful context-based compression.

   SAM (Source Address Mode) MUST be set to 11 to indicate that the
   address is fully elided.

3.3.2.  Destination Address Compression

   DAC (Destination Address Compression) MUST be set to 1 to indicate
   stateful context-based compression.

   DAM (Destination Address Mode) MUST be set to 11 to indicate that the
   address is fully elided.

3.3.3.  Context Identifier

   When non-IEEE-identifier-based addresses are used as specified in
   this document, each address MUST be associated with a separate
   context.  That is, the "prefix" associated with a context MUST be the
   full 128 bits of the IPv6 address.

   LOWPAN_IPHC supports up to 16 source address contexts and 16
   destination address contexts, allowing for simultaneous use of up to
   16 source addresses and 16 destination addresses that are not IEEE-
   identifier based.  Context 0 is the default context if the CID
   (Context Identifier Extension) octet is absent, and other values
   require the CID to be present.  As such, the address most commonly
   used (typically either the stable non-temporary address, or the
   currently preferred temporary address) could be assigned to context 0
   so that the presence of the CID octet is minimized.

3.3.4.  Context State

   As specified in [RFC6775], context state is distributed by routers
   and is shared across a LoWPAN.  This means that the use of CIDs
   described above would only support compression of 16 source and
   destination addresses across the entire LoWPAN.  However, Section 8
   of [RFC6775] explicitly allows for such context dissemination to be
   substituted by alternatives defined in other specifications.  We now
   describe such a substitute that would allow header compression with
   up to 16 source addresses and 16 destination addresses *per node*.

   First, a context entry is defined to be indexed by a { link-layer
   address, CID } tuple, rather than just a CID.  Second, each node is
   responsible for generating and disseminating the CIDs for its own
   IPv6 addresses.

   Thus, each Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) conceptually contains the CID
   of the neighbor's address, used when compressing packets sent to it.

3.3.5.  Context Distribution

   To disseminate CID information from a host to a router, the Address
   Registration Option (ARO) defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC6775] can be
   extended to include the CID by using 5 of the 24 Reserved bits (one
   for a flag to denote a CID is present, and 4 for the CID).
   Similarly, the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate Address
   Confirmation (DAC) messages can be extended to include the CID in
   currently Reserved bits.

   Specifying further details of such a scheme is left for future
   versions of this draft, if there is interest.
