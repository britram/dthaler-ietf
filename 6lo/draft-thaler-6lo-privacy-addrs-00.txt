         Enabling Privacy Addressing With 6LoWPAN Technologies
                   draft-thaler-6lo-privacy-addrs-00

Abstract

   A potentially common misconception is that header 6LowPAN header
   compression is incompatible (or at least inefficient) with the notion
   of using addresses with sufficient entropy.  This draft attempts to
   dispel that notion, and specifies how privacy addressing can be used
   on 6LoWPAN technologies, without additional overhead in data packets.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6973 [RFC6973] discusses privacy considerations for Internet
   protocols, and Section 5.2 in particular covers a number of privacy-
   specific threats.  In the context of IPv6 address, Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy] provides further
   elaboration on the applicability of the privacy threats.  When
   interface identifiers (IIDs) are generated without sufficient
   entropy, devices and users become vulnerable to the various threats
   discussed there, including correlation of activities over time,
   location tracking, address scanning, and device-specific
   vulnerability exploitation.

   Interfaces identifiers formed from IEEE identifiers can have
   insufficient entropy unless the IEEE identifier itself has sufficient
   entropy, has enough (typically 64 or more) bits of entropy carried
   over into the IPv6 address to have a sufficiently large "anonymity
   set" as defined in [RFC6973].  Furthermore, IEEE-identifier-based
   IIDs are also insufficient to prevent location tracking unless the
   IEEE identifier itself is different at each network location.  This
   observation suggests that the privacy threats can be mitigated in
   either of two ways: either make sure the IEEE identifier contains 64
   bits of entropy and is changed if a device moves to a different
   network, or else use an IPv6 address generation mechanism that is not
   IEEE-identifier-based.

   Furthermore, to mitigate the threat of correlation of activities over
   time, [RFC4941] specifies the notion of a "temporary" address to be
   used for sessions that should not be linkable to more permanent
   identifiers (such as a DNS name or stable hardware address).  Such
   temporary addresses are appropriate for connections (typically
   locally-initiated outbound sessions) that do not use a stable
   identifier at a higher layer, such as a user name or hostname.

   Indeed, the default address selection rules [RFC6724] now prefer
   temporary addresses by default for outgoing connections.  A new
   temporary address is periodically (default is 1 day in xref
   target='RFC4941'/>) generated, which limits the threat of correlation
   of activies over time to that period.  The address itself though may
   still be usable for existing long-lived connections (but not new
   connections) for some longer period (default is 1 week); this allows
   for not breaking application sessions, especially those that might be
   initiated shortly before a new temporary address is generated.  This
   fact means that multiple temporary addresses will exist at the same
   time, one for new connections, and one or more (often up to 6, per
   the default periods) old ones for long-lived connections.  This is in
   addition to zero or more "stable" addresses that might be used for
   connections that are linkable to more permanent identifiers such as
   DNS names or user names.

   Finally, allowing efficient use of addresses that are not IEEE-
   identifier based also has additional security benefits not specific
   to privacy.  For example, addresses such as Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972] and Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs)
   [RFC5535] can be used in security protocols such as Secure Neighbor
   Discovery (SeND) [RFC6496], IPsec, etc.

   There has been some concern that such approaches would necessarily
   interfere with efficient header compression for IPv6 over IEEE
   802.15.4-based networks [RFC6282], as it is important to keep data
   packets small on such networks.  This document specifies how to use
   such addresses on these networks while avoiding extra overhead.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in Section 3 of [RFC6973],
   including terms such as "(un)linkability" and "anonymity set".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Details

   RFC 6282 [RFC6282] defines a method for deriving IIDs from the source
   and/or destination addresses in the encapsulation header.  Unicast
   IPv6 addresses may be compressed to 64, 16, or 0 bits in the encoded
   IPv6 header.

   A stable per-network random ID generation mechanism could be at layer
   2 and that essentially becomes another variant way to implement
   [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] if it's 64 bits of entropy.

   An IID generated from a random 16-bit address per Section 3.2.2 of
   [RFC6973] is not sufficient to mitigate address scanning, and also
   does not sufficiently increase the size of the "anonymity set"
   defined in [RFC6973].  The size of the address scan search space
   depends on the entropy in the IID.  An adversary could also use
   statisical methods to determine the size of the L2 address space and
   thereby make some inference regarding the underlying technology on a
   given link.

   However, either way it doesn't expand the packet if there's 0 address
   bits in the packet.

6.  Security Considerations

   This entire document is about security considerations and
   mitigations.

   RFC 6775 [RFC6775] section 11 states, "In some future deployments,
   one might want to use SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971]
   [RFC3972].  This is possible with the ARO as sent between hosts and
   routers, since the address that is being registered is the IPv6
   source address of the NS and SEND verifies the IPv6 source address of
   the packet."
