1.  Introduction

   RFC 6973 [RFC6973] discusses privacy considerations for Internet
   protocols, and Section 5.2 in particular covers a number of privacy-
   specific threats.  In the context of IPv6 addresses, Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy] provides further
   elaboration on the applicability of the privacy threats.  When
   interface identifiers (IIDs) are generated without sufficient entropy
   compared to the link lifetime, devices and users can become
   vulnerable to the various threats discussed there, including
   correlation of activities over time, location tracking, address
   scanning, and device-specific vulnerability exploitation.

   Interfaces identifiers formed from IEEE identifiers can have
   insufficient entropy unless the IEEE identifier itself has sufficient
   entropy, and enough bits of entropy are carried over into the IPv6
   address to sufficiently mitigate the threats.  Typically "enough"
   bits of entropy means at least 46 bits (see Appendix for why);
   ideally all 64 bits of the IID should be used, although historically
   some bits have been excluded for reasons discussed in [RFC7421].

   Furthermore, IEEE-identifier-based IIDs are also insufficient to
   prevent location tracking unless the IEEE identifier itself is
   different at each network location.  This observation suggests that
   the privacy threats can be mitigated in either of two ways: either
   use an IPv6 address generation mechanism that is not IEEE-identifier-
   based, or else make sure the IEEE identifier contains at least 46
   bits of entropy and is changed if a device moves to a different
   network.  For this reason, [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids] recommends
   using the address generation scheme in [RFC7217] by default, rather
   than IEEE-identifier-based addresses.

   Furthermore, to mitigate the threat of correlation of activities over
   time, [RFC4941] specifies the notion of a "temporary" address to be
   used for sessions that should not be linkable to a more permanent
   identifier (such as a DNS name, user name, or stable hardware
   address).  Such temporary addresses are appropriate for connections
   (typically locally-initiated outbound sessions) that an attacker
   cannot link to a stable identifier such as a user name or DNS name.
   Indeed, the default address selection rules [RFC6724] now prefer
   temporary addresses by default for outgoing connections.  When
   temporary addresses are used, a new temporary address is periodically
   (default is 1 day in [RFC4941]) generated, which limits the threat of
   correlation of activies over time to that period.  The address itself
   though may still be usable for existing long-lived connections (but
   not new connections) for some longer period (default is 1 week); this
   allows for not breaking application sessions, especially those that
   might be initiated shortly before a new temporary address is
   generated.  This fact means that multiple temporary addresses can
   exist at the same time, one for new connections, and one or more
   (often up to 6, per the default periods) old ones for long-lived
   connections.  This is in addition to any "stable" addresses that
   might be used for connections that are linkable to more permanent
   identifiers such as DNS names or user names.  Whereas most threats
   could be mitigated if the IEEE identifier contains sufficient entropy
   and is different per-network, mitigating the threat of correlation of
   activities over time typically cannot be done using an IEEE-
   identifier-based-IID, since mitigating such a threat typically
   involves the ability to use multiple IPv6 addresses simultaneously
   whereas typically only one IEEE identifier can be used at a time.

   Finally, allowing efficient use of addresses that are not IEEE-
   identifier-based also has additional security benefits not specific
   to privacy.  For example, addresses such as Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972] and Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs)
   [RFC5535] can be used in security protocols such as Secure Neighbor
   Discovery (SeND) [RFC6496], IPsec, etc.  Such techniques rely on
   having around 59 or more bits of entropy in the address to provide
   sufficient cryptographic protection.

   Another potential concern is that of efficiency, such as avoiding DAD
   all together when IPv6 addresses are IEEE-identifier-based.
   Appendix A of [RFC4429] provides an analysis of address collision
   probability based on the number of bits of entropy.  A simple web
   search on "duplicate MAC addresses" will show that collisions do
   happen with MAC addresses, and thus based on the analysis in
   [RFC4429], using sufficient bits of entropy in non-IEEE-identifier-
   based addresses can provide greater protection against collision than
   using MAC addresses.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in Section 3 of [RFC6973],
   including terms such as "(un)linkability" and "anonymity set".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Amount of Entropy Needed

   In terms of privacy threats discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy], the one with the
   need for the most entropy is address scans.  To mitigate address
   scans, one needs enough entropy to make the probability of a
   successful address probe be negligible.  Typically this is measured
   in the length of time it would take to have a 50% probability of
   getting at least one hit.  Address scans often rely on sending a
   packet such as a TCP SYN or ICMP Echo Request, and determining
   whether the reply is an ICMP unreachable errors (if no host exists)
   or TCP response or ICMP Echo Reply (if a host exists), or neither in
   which case nothing is known for certain.

   Many privacy-sensitive devices support a "stealth mode" as discussed
   in Section 5 of [RFC7288] whereby they will not send a TCP RST or
   ICMP Echo Reply.  In such cases, and when the device does not listen
   on a well-known TCP port known to the scanner, the effectiveness of
   an address scan is limited by the ability to get ICMP unreachable
   errors, since the attacker can only infer the presence of a host
   based on the absense of an ICMP unreachable error.

   Generation of ICMP unreachable errors is typically rate limited to 2
   per second (the default in routers such as Cisco routers running IOS
   12.0 or later).  Such a rate results in taking about a year to
   completely scan 26 bits of space.  For a network with at most 2^16
   devices on the same subnet, and the average lifetime of a device
   being 16 (2^4) years or less, this results in a need for at least 46
   bits of entropy (16+26+4) so that a address scan would need to be
   sustained for longer than the lifetime of devices to have a 50%
   chance of getting a hit.

   The actual math is as follows.  Let 2^N be the number of devices on
   the subnet.  Let 2^M be the size of the space to scan (i.e., M bits
   of entropy).  Let S be the number of scan attempts.  The formula is:
   P(at least one success) = 1 - (1 - 2^N/2^M)^S = 1/2.  Assuming 2^M >>
   S, this simplifies to: S * 2^N/2^M = 1/2, giving S = 2^(M-N) / 2, or
   M = N + log_2(2S).

   Although 46 bits of entropy may be enough to provide privacy in such
   cases, 59 or more bits of entropy are needed if addresses are used to
   provide security against attacks such as spoofing, as CGAs [RFC3972]
   and HBAs [RFC5535] do, since attacks are not limited by ICMP rate
   limiting but by the processing power of the attacker.  See those RFCs
   for more discussion.

   If, on the other hand, the devices being scanned for do not implement
   a "stealth mode", but respond with TCP RST or ICMP Echo Reply
   packets, then the address scan is not limited by the ICMP unreachable
   rate limit in routers, since the attacker can determine the presence
   of a host without them.  In such cases, more bits of entropy would be
   needed to provide the same level of protection.

     +---------------+--------------------------+--------------------+

5.  Potential Approaches

5.1.  Random IEEE-Identifier-Based Addresses

   As noted earlier, some threats could be mitigated using per-network
   "randomized" IEEE identifiers with 46 or more bits of entropy.  A
   number of such proposals can be found at
   <https://mentor.ieee.org/privecsg/documents>, and Section 10.8 of
   [BTCorev4.1] specifies one for Bluetooth.  Using IPv6 addresses
   derived from such IEEE identifiers would be roughly equivalent to
   those specified in [RFC7217].

5.2.  Short Addresses

   An IPv6 address formed (per Section 6 of [RFC4944]) from an 16-bit
   identifier such as an IEEE 802.15.4 16-bit short address does not
   provide sufficient entropy to fully mitigate address scanning, as the
   size of the address scan search space depends on the entropy in the

   IID, and only 15 bits are available for unicast addresses.  An
   adversary could also use statisical methods to determine the size of
   the L2 address space and thereby make some inference regarding the
   underlying technology being IEEE 802.15.4 on a given link.  As such,
   this address generation mechanism SHOULD NOT be used on networks
   where privacy threats may be an issue, such as any networks that have
   Internet connectivity.

   It might be possible to construct IPv6 addresses from 16-bit short
   addresses using an alternate mechanism that mitigates address scans,
   if all nodes on a given L2 network have a shared secret (such as the
   key needed to get on the layer-2 network) and generate the IID by
   using a one-way 64-bit hash of the shared secret together with the
   short address.  The use of such a hash would result in the IIDs being
   spread out among the full range of IID address space.

   "Temporary" addresses could possibly be generated in the same way by
   also including in the hash the Version Number from the Authoritative
   Border Router Option (ABDO) if any.  This would allow changing
   temporary addresses whenever the Version Number is changed (even if
   the set of prefix or context information is unchanged).  Such a
   scheme would likely require using the Context Identifier (CID) to
   distinguish between non-temporary addresses, "current" temporary
   addresses, and "past" temporary addresses based on a previous Version
   Number.
